**Lightweight, fast and simple library to communicate with one or two MPU6050's**

:arrows_counterclockwise: Your feedback is important. Any issue or suggestion can be reported to the Github `Issues` section


## Description

The library is made to retrieve accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from the MPU6050. This data is processed using a complementary filter to provide and estimation of tilt angles on X and Y with respect to the horizontal frame. The hypothesis for the validity of these angles are:
* small linear accelerations (the gravity is the dominant one)
* small loop delay between two calls to `update()` so the approximation `angle[t]=angle[t-1]+gyro*dt` is valid
* heading (angle Z) is valid for small X and Y angles

## New feature

Now you can use this library with two MPU's. You just have to tight the AD0 from one MPU to VCC and the other one to GND. The code will be like:

`MPU6050 mpu1(Wire, 0x68);`

`MPU6050 mpu2(Wire, 0x69);`

or you can go with the old style:

`MPU6050 mpu(Wire);`

## Documentation

A documentation PDF is provided within the library folder, otherwise get it online at [https://github.com/rfetick/MPU6050_light](https://github.com/rfetick/MPU6050_light). It includes definitions of the functions and gives a minimal example of usage of the code. More examples can be found in the dedicated `examples/` subfolder of the library.
